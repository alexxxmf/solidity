## Notes feature

Feature to take personal notes (advocate) related to a particular session. Once in screen, if you go back it automatically saves your notes and links them to that particular session so next time you use the notes for the same session you will be able to see everything.

### Why it was removed?

It is not used so instead of hiding it behind a flag better to get a leaner build by removing it.

## Print PDF feature

Feature to download pdfs and send to printer the content fro the sessions. It picks up the pdfs straight from S3. We used to produced them with a script that turns web pages into single pdfs and then with a pdf library we can easily bundle them together.
